#Write a Python program using a while loop that lets the user guess a secret number between 1 and 10.
#The program should:

#Ask the user to guess the number.

#If the guess is too high, print "Too high!"

#If the guess is too low, print "Too low!"

#If the guess is correct, print "You guessed it!" and stop.
